# Introduction

AlgoWorld is an NFT project created in April 2021 on the Algorand
blockchain. It first started with a set of 1500 NFT cards depicting the
193 United Nations countries around the world. Six special cards
depicting continents and the world were added to reward the best
AlgoWorld cards owners.

Then, a brand new feature was introduced in June 2021: the possibility
to build AlgoWorld Cities (100 units cards for each city) by using the
AlgoWorld Token, distributed as a reward to AlgoWorld cards owners. An
additional set of 34 non-member states country cards was created in
November 2021.

The AlgoWorld Token is a 10,000,000 units verified Algorand Standard
Asset, with no decimal. The asset ID is 233939122. The creator address
is:
GRV2SXHUXIHF4C5KDMC6KUH47BTBCLWJFEXM464GUTXU3BDEHE634Y6K2U.
This White Paper describes the AlgoWord Cities feature and the AlgoWorld
Token distribution model.

about the project.

# AlgoWorld Cities feature

This feature allows members to create and upgrade new AlgoWorld Cities
by using AlgoWorld Tokens. **All AWT used to build or upgrade cities are
permanently removed from circulation.**

## Building Cities

Everyone can build new AlgoWorld Cities using AlgoWorld Tokens. Each
city is a 100-units card, represented by an Algorand Standard Asset. The
builder gets to choose the free of rights picture that is used for the
card. The amount of units sent is variable, depending on the ownership
of a country card of the city by the builder.

<div id="tab:widgets">

| Condition            | Units sent to builder |
| :------------------- | :-------------------: |
| No country card      |          50           |
| Regular country card |          55           |
| Diamond country card |          60           |

Number of city cards sent

</div>

The units left are kept for random city packs available for sale on the
AlgoWorld Explorer.

_For instance, Joe books Boston, USA. He does not have any USA country
cards. He will receive 50 Boston cards. The 50 other cards will be kept
for city packs. Donald books Mexico City, Mexico. He has a Mexico
diamond country card. He will receive 60 Mexico City cards. 40 cards
will be kept for city packs._

**Important: the same city can be built only once.**

The price to build a city is adjusted every month according to the
number of bookings.

-   The price is unchanged if there are between 10 and 20 cities booked
    in the previous month.

-   If less than 10 cities are booked in the previous month : price
    decreases by 500 AWT

-   If more than 20 cities are booked in the previous month : prince
    increases by 500 AWT

Floor price is 1500 AWT per city. The booking form, list of booked
cities, and current city building price are available on [the AlgoWorld
website](https://www.algoworld.io/city-booking).

## Upgrading Cities

Each city can be upgraded using AlgoWorld Token on the AlgoWorld
Explorer. Sending AWT increases the influence points of a city and makes
it earn more rewards (see
<a href="#CR" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="CR">[CR]</a>
"City Rewards"). 1 AWT sent adds 1 influence point to the city. There
are 7 different ranks. The city with the highest influence is the
AlgoWorld Capital.

<div id="tab:widgets">

| AlgoWorld City rank     | Influence points |
| :---------------------- | ---------------: |
| AlgoWorld Regular City  |             0-99 |
| AlgoWorld Bronze City   |          100-499 |
| AlgoWorld Silver City   |          500-999 |
| AlgoWorld Gold City     |        1000-1999 |
| AlgoWorld Platinum City |        2000-2999 |
| AlgoWorld Diamond City  |            3000+ |
| AlgoWorld Capital       |    Highest score |

    time. The sales will never exceed 40,000 AWT/month. This fund is
    also used to provide liquidity in AMM.

-   A budget of 1,000,000 AWT is introduced to incentivize AWT liquidity
    providers.

-   The early buyers compensation program of 41,500 AWT aimed to give a
    bonus for early AWT buyers. It was fulfilled in 2021.

-   A budget of 1,158,500 AWT (around 10% of total supply) is not
    allocated yet. Its allocation will be decided later on, after
    consultation of the community.

that each city has 100 cards. The total amount of city rewards
(3,000,000 AWT) is split into three tranches of 1,000,000 AWT each.

<div id="tab:widgets">

AWT/weekly during the first tranche distribution._

### Liquidity providing rewards

AWT rewards will be sent weekly to liquidity providers. The total amount
dedicated to this category is 1,000,000 AWT. 2% of AWT provided to
Tinyman Algo/AWT liquidity pool will be sent every week to each
liquidity provider. This distribution rate could be changed to
distribute the liquidity rewards over 2 to 4 years.

Games such as treasure hunts will be organized to have roughly 100,000
AWT distributed each year.
